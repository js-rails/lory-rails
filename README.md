Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/lory/rails`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lory-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lory-rails
    
And then edit your app/assets/stylesheets/application.js file to look something like:
``` css
/*
*= require_self
*= require jqeury
*= require jquery-ui
*= require lory
*= require_tree .
*/
```

Integration as a jQuery Plugin add jquery.lory
``` css
/*
*= require_self
*= require jqeury
*= require jquery-ui
*= require jquery.lory
*= require_tree .
*/
```

**lory-rails is dependant on jQuery, so make sure you have it in your Gemfile.**
